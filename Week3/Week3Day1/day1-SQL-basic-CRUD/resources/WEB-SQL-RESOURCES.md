## Online resources for SQL and sqlite

* <https://selectstarsql.com/> a thorough tutorial on sqlite3 using real world data. I highly suggest downloading the data, creating the database, and following along with the exercises.

* <http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/> another tutorial organized by different functions. This one works very well as a reference to look at while doing other work.

* <http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-python/> from the same people, a tutorial and reference for python's sqlite3
