## What's going on in this example

This code is populating a database from a .csv file and then demonstrating some example functions.

I included the step of cleaning up the csv data (the original file has quotation marks that result in weird column names). A lot of the actual work of working with data is this kind of manipulation.

The SELECT file creates generic functions for executing SQL queries and printing their results. See if you can figure out what all it's doing.
