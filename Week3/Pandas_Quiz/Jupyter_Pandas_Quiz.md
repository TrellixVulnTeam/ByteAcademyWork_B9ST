# Quiz 2: Jupyter & Pandas

Read the attached `.csv` file into a pandas Dataframe, in a Jupyter Notebook. Create a Jupyter Notebook that contains the following:

* Calculate the average closing price of TSLA (from the `.csv` file)

* Create a scatter plot of average closing prices over time

* Create a new column in your Dataframe (name it whatever you want) that contains a Boolean value corresponding to whether that row's Closing Price is greater or less than the average

Submit the `.ipynb` file of your notebook by 11:00. If you have any questions let your instructors know, and feel free to re-use code from your lectures.

BONUS: If you finish early, create an additional column "Rolling Close" that contains the cumulative sum of the Closing Price column (meaning the first value will be row 0's 'Closing Price', the second will be row 0 + row 1, etc.)
