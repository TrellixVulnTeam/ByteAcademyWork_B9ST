## Adventure Game

You are going to create an adventure game. In your game a player will enter keyboard commands to wander around a world. You will need at least the following classes:

* Player

* Monster

* Location

You may need subclasses for Monster and Location. You can implement more features, such as object your player can pick up and carry or use in a fight.

Run controller.py to see the sample code in action.

#### Player

A player object should keep track of the player's health (which can be hurt by monster attacks) and any other statistics needed to decide combat. The Player class should keep track of their current location.

Currently, the player keeps track of how much damage they have taken in combat with a HP (hit points) score

#### Monster

A monster object should keep track of the monster's health and any other statistics needed for combat.

#### Location

A location should have a description and a list of locations the player can travel to from there. The location should also keep track of whether any monsters are present.

### Design Your Game:

* Come up with an interesting setting of your choice

* What features would be interesting to add to players and monsters? Maybe monsters could move from place to place. Maybe the player could run away from a fight.

* You can add any other features you like. Perhaps the player should be able to find and collect items that can be used in combat or at certain locations.

* You could add other people in the world who are not enemies to fight.

* You could develop a way to save and load a game from a file

* There could be a task that must be completed in a certain amount of time.

* The only limit is your imagination.
